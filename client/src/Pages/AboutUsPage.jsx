                    Welcome to EventConnect, your go-to platform for
                    discovering, organizing, and participating in exciting
                    events! We aim to bring people together by providing a
                    seamless experience for exploring and managing events,
                    whether they are cultural festivals, tech meetups, college
                    fests, or professional conferences.

                <p className="text-md">
                    Our mission is to simplify event management and discovery by
                    creating an interactive space where users can explore
                    upcoming events, register with ease, and stay updated with
                    real-time notifications. Whether you are an organizer
                    looking for an efficient way to promote your event or an
                    attendee eager to find new experiences, EventConnect is here
                    for you!

                <h2 className="w-full text-center my-6">Why We Started?</h2>
                <p className="text-md">
                    We noticed that many event organizers face challenges in
                    reaching their target audience, and attendees often struggle
                    to find events that match their interests. To bridge this
                    gap, we built EventConnectâ€”a dynamic platform that connects
                    event hosts with attendees, making event management more
                    accessible and engaging.
